Sleep is a batch file sleep command used to pause batch files, 
and causes command execution to sleep for a given number of seconds.

It's similar to the sleep.exe that is included with the Windows Resource Kit, 
but here you don't need to download and install the entire kit!

You can integrate Sleep into batch files and scripts to pause the execution of a batch file 
for a specified period of time.
